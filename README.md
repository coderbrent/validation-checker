# validation-checker

A simple javascript input validation utility function that takes a field type (supports any html5 input type, ie. name, email, tel), user input and then checks that given user input against a regex pattern.

Special thanks and credit to Andrew Woods and this awesomely helpful blog post he wrote here -> <a href="https://andrewwoods.net/blog/2018/name-validation-regex/">his blog</a> for the regex name pattern I used for this script!
